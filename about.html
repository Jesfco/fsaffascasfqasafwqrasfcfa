            <h2 class="section-title">How We Came Together</h2>
            <p class="origin-text">
               Tacism Studios came together organically from the ULSS community, where members were passionate about expanding the variety of immersive LSPDFR callouts. The demand sparked the formation of a dev team when sols, an early contributor, took the lead in organizing the project. Shortly after, Dr. Mamba joined the effort, followed by Maminka, a well-known figure in the community for providing tech support. The team grew stronger, and after a few collaborative development cycles, sols stepped down as lead developer. Dr. Mamba assumed the leadership role, with Maminka stepping into an executive management position to keep operations smooth and focused. With the release of their first callout pack, interest in the community grew quickly. That success drew the attention of Demon Hunter, another talented developer, who was brought onto the team after a careful review of their work. Since then, Tacism Studios has continued expanding with new ideas, improved stability, and a shared goal of raising the standard for immersive law enforcement gameplay in GTA V.

                       Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Dr. Mamba one of the lead developers here at Tacism Studios. I‚Äôm currently studying cybersecurity full time while working in an IT role, while my hobbies are taking long walks/hikes.

I‚Äôve loved GTA V since the day it dropped, and LSPDFR completely changed the game for me. There‚Äôs just something about stepping into the role of an officer, responding to dynamic calls, and making each patrol feel like an episode of a gritty police drama it‚Äôs chef‚Äôs kiss. Joining this project has been a blast, and I‚Äôm excited to help bring more immersive, realistic, and meaningful callouts to the community.

I‚Äôve had the chance to be involved in just about everything from core development to experimental features.
Working with such a dedicated and creative team has been nothing short of inspiring, and I‚Äôm excited for everything we‚Äôre building both now and in the future. There‚Äôs a lot more to come, and I‚Äôm all in.
